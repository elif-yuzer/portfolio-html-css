          <h3>HTML</h3>
          <p>
            HTML is the foundational building block of web pages, defining their
            structure and content. My HTML courses cover everything from basic
            tags to complex structures, emphasizing the latest features of
            HTML5. Students learn to create accessible, standard-compliant web
            pages that are also SEO-friendly. The training is designed for
            learners at all levels, aiming to thoroughly grasp the fundamentals
            of web development.

          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <p>
            CSS is a crucial tool for styling and enhancing the aesthetics and
            user experience of web pages. In my courses, students explore
            everything from CSS selectors to advanced animations, layout
            techniques, and responsive design principles. The focus is on modern
            layout systems like Flexbox and Grid, equipping students to create
            clean, effective, and maintainable style sheets. These courses blend
            both theoretical and practical aspects of CSS.

          <h3>REACT</h3>
          <p>
            React, a popular JavaScript library for user interface development,
            is a key focus of my training program. Starting from the basics, the
            courses cover state management, life cycle methods, and creating
            reusable components. I emphasize modern features like React Hooks
            and the Context API, preparing students to develop interactive and
            contemporary web applications. The training is aimed at equipping
            developers with up-to-date React development skills.

          <h3>NODE.JS</h3>
          <p>
            Node.js enables server-side JavaScript execution and is a powerful
            platform for web server development. My training spans Node.js's
            fundamentals to RESTful API development and database integration.
            Students delve into advanced topics like asynchronous programming
            and performance optimization. The practical, real-world examples in
            the course aim to empower students to build robust, scalable
            server-side applications.

          <i class="fa-brands fa-sass"></i>
          <h3>SASS</h3>
          <p>
            SASS, a preprocessor language, enhances the dynamism and modularity
            of CSS. My courses cover SASS from its basics to advanced concepts,
            teaching cleaner, sustainable, and manageable style sheet creation.
            We focus on the efficiency of SASS in reducing code redundancy and
            enhancing project productivity. SASS is presented as a vital skill
            in modern web design, integral to creating sophisticated styles.

          <i class="fa-brands fa-bootstrap"></i>
          <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
          <p>
            Bootstrap is a preferred front-end framework for rapid and effective
            web page design. My training comprehensively covers Bootstrap's grid
            system, components, and helper classes. Learners understand how to
            design modern, professional, mobile-responsive web pages, benefiting
            from Bootstrap’s ease of use and wide applicability. The course is
            tailored for developers at all levels, focusing on practical skills
            for efficiency and rapid prototyping.
